# Website Performance Optimization

This project involved the challenge of tackling, and correcting, some performance-related issues
that on an existing website for a pizzeria that was provided to me. The main tasks were to achieve a [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) score of 90+ for index.html,
achieving 60 Frames Per Second for pizza.html, and getting the pizza size animations on pizza.html to resize in under 5 ms.

To test the optimizations implemented for pizza.html please [**Click Here**](http://samurairanderson.github.io/P4-Website-Optimization/views/pizza.html).

Comments for specific changes made can be found nested within index.html, views/pizza.html, views/js/main.js, and view/css/style.css.

Below is an overview of the optimizations, modifications, and tests performed to meet the rubric specifications for this project.

## Part One: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Measured the initial Google PageSpeed Insight scores which were - Mobile: 26/100, Desktop: 29/100.

Modifications and Optimizations Implemented:
* Removed Web Fonts.
* Added media query to print.css.
* Inlined style.css.
* Resized, compressed, and locally stored the images used.
* Inlined google-analytics.js file.
* Async the js/analytics.js & js/perfmatters.js files.

Measured performance after making the above changes and they were - Mobile: 93/100, Desktop: 95/100.

## Part Two: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

Measured the initial Frames Per Second which were between 20 - 30 fps.

Modifications and Optimizations Implemented:
* Added meta info to pizza.html.
* Reduced the number of pizza's generated from 200 to 30.
* Compressed, and resized, images.
* Utilized style.css to assign properties to pizza images.
* Compressed, and inlined, style.css.
* Modified/Optimized Javascript. Changes are outlined in the comments within main.js.

Measured performance after the above changes and it is now running at 60 FPS.

## Part Three: Computation Efficiency

Measured the initial resize time which was 83.33 ms.

Modifications and Optimizations implemented to get the time to resize pizza's less than 5 ms:
* Modified/Optimized Javascript, CSS and HTML to achieve the final result.
* Replaced "randomPizzaContainer" (377 main.js) with "randomPizzaContainerMedium" (387 main.js) and created
  a corresponding class for each size within 'function sizeSwitcher(size)' (434 main.js). I updated
  pizza.html as a result of this change (109 & 126 in pizza.html).
* As a result of the changes made to "function sizeSwitcher(size)" I updated style.css for each size.
* Utilized a technique by Paul Lewis (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/animations/) to rewrite
  the scroll function.
* Removed the DOM access from the for loop in "function updatePositions()" to boost performance and avoid
  triggering a unnecessary layouts.

Measures performance after the above changes and resizing pizzas is now at 0.46 ms.
